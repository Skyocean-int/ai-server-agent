# Data Flow Architecture

## Query Processing Flow

1. User Input
   - Query received via Web UI
   - Validated and sanitized
   - Routed to Query Handler

2. File Access Layer
   - SSH connection management
   - Redis caching
   - Path validation and security

3. Knowledge Base
   - Document processing
   - Vector embeddings
   - FAISS indexing

4. RAG System
   - Context retrieval
   - Response formatting
   - LLM integration

## Security Flow

1. Input Validation
   - Path sanitization
   - Command filtering
   - Authentication checks

2. Data Access
   - SSH key management
   - Cache encryption
   - Access logging

3. Response Processing
   - Data sanitization
   - Error handling
   - Response validation
